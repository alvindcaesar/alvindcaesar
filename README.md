# Yo! 🤘
## My name is Alvind Caesar ⚡😎

I am an independent web developer and an aspiring indie hacker who hails from Sabah, Malaysia. 

My work revolves primarily around custom [WordPress](https://wordpress.org) website and theme/plugin development but I also work with the [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org) framework.

## 💻 My Tech Stack:
✔️ PHP / Ruby / WordPress with [Timber](https://upstatement.com/timber/) / Ruby on Rails / Laravel <br>
✔️ MySQL / Postgres <br>
✔️ Cyberpanel / Runcloud / Heroku <br>
✔️ [DigitalOcean](https://m.do.co/c/b461caa6b976) / Vultr / AWS <br>
✔️ ..and an unhealthy amount of caffeine in order for all of the above to work together. ☕<br>

> *I'm currently open for any projects in accordance with the tech stack above. If you have any project in mind that need helps, don't hesitate to email me at* [`hello@alvindcaesar.com`](mailto:hello@alvindcaesar.com).
