# Yo! 🤘
## My name is Alvind Caesar ⚡😎

I am an independent web developer and an aspiring indie hacker who hails from Sabah, Malaysia. 

My work revolves primarily around custom [WordPress](https://wordpress.org) website and theme/plugin development but I also work with the [Laravel](https://laravel.com) framework.

<!-- ## 💻 My Tech Stack:
✔️ PHP || WordPress with [Timber](https://upstatement.com/timber/) || Laravel<br>
✔️ MySQL || Postgres <br>
✔️ Cyberpanel || Runcloud || Heroku <br>
✔️ [DigitalOcean](https://m.do.co/c/b461caa6b976) || Vultr || AWS <br>
✔️ ..and an unhealthy amount of caffeine in order for all of the above to work together. ☕<br> -->

> *I'm currently open  any projects in accordance with the tech stack above. If you have any project in mind that needs help, don't hesitate to email me at* [`hello@alvindcaesar.com`](mailto:hello@alvindcaesar.com).
