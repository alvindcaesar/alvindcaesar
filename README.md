# Yo! ðŸ¤˜
## My name is Alvind Caesar âš¡ðŸ˜Ž

I am an independent web developer and an aspiring indie hacker who hails from Sabah, Malaysia. 

My work revolves primarily around [WordPress](wordpress.org) development but I also work with the [Ruby on Rails](rubyonrails.org) framework.

## ðŸ’» My Tech Stack:
* PHP / Ruby / WordPress with [Timber](https://upstatement.com/timber/) or [Bedrock](https://roots.io/bedrock/) / Ruby on Rails / Laravel
* MySQL / Postgres
* Cyberpanel / Runcloud / Heroku
* [DigitalOcean](https://m.do.co/c/b461caa6b976) / AWS / Heroku
* ..and an unhealthy amount of caffeine in order for all of the above to work together.

> *I'm currently open for any dev jobs in accordance with the tech stack above. If you have any project in mind that need helps, don't hesitate to email me at [`hello@alvindcaesar.com`](mailto:hello@alvindcaesar.com) or send your inquiry directly at [`https://alvindcaesar.com/contact`](https://alvindcaesar.com/contact).*
