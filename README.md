### Hi! I'm Alvind. Need something coded? I'm your man. âš¡ðŸ˜Ž

I am an independent web developer who hails from Sabah, East Malaysia. 

My work revolves primarily around custom [WordPress](https://wordpress.org) website and theme/plugin development but sometimes I also work with the [Laravel](https://laravel.com) framework.

Some of my personal projects I currently enjoyed doing (*These are a non-exhaustive list!*):
* [Billplz for Contact Form 7](https://github.com/alvindcaesar/billplz-for-contact-form-7) - Accept payment in Contact Form 7 by using Billplz Payment Gateway.
* [Billplz for WP Smart Pay](https://github.com/alvindcaesar/billplz-for-wpsmartpay) - A Billplz Payment Gateway extension for [WP Smart Pay](https://wpsmartpay.com).
* [Bloat Buster](https://github.com/alvindcaesar/bloat-buster) - A super simple plugin to remove bloat from your WordPress site.
* [Dead Simple Maintenance Mode](https://github.com/alvindcaesar/dead-simple-maintenance-mode ) - Simple and bloat free maintenance mode plugin for WordPress.
* [Shortcuts for GeneratePress](https://github.com/alvindcaesar/gp-shortcuts) - Adds a helpful menu to the admin bar to easily jump straight into GeneratePress and GenerateBlocks menus and settings.
